        Getting Started
    </h1>
    <p>
        You just saw an input form for solving nonlinear equations.
        To solve any just fill in all empty fields and press the 'Solve' button.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Important caveats
    </h2>
    <p>
        All equations You enter must have only one variable, with 'x' name
    </p>
    <p>
        In case of any error You'll see the appropriate message (Exception text)
    </p>
    <p>
        If You are not satisfied with the answer or the answer was not found
        here is the possible solutions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Change initial x range (left and right bound)
        </li>
        <li>
            Change amount of iterations
        </li>
        <li>
            Change precision
        </li>
    </ul>
